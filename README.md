Sustainable Construction: YOLOv8 + Arduino Prototype AiAC

This is the development and implementation of YOLOv8 + Arduino Prototype to support sustainable concrete upcycling by improving the Big Bag recycling system. Our team created a custom dataset and trained a YOLOv8 model for object detection of scrap concrete pieces. The results were integrated into an Arduino Uno setup, where detections were logged and visualized through LED indicators. 

This project combines computer vision, embedded hardware, and sustainability goals to demonstrate how AI can contribute to more efficient construction waste management.
